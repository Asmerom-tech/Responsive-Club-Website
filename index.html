        <p>Join the club for fun on run. Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing
          <br> humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait 
          <br> characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though 
          <br> there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always
          <br>  in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of 
          <br>  gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs.</p>
